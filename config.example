## Siph can use a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS in order to reduce
## bandwidth usage (and be friendly to our upstreams).  A caching
## proxy will speed up APT and Quicklisp downloads.  Uncomment and set
## the following variables if you have a proxy to use:
##
# http_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8123"
# https_proxy="http://127.0.0.1:8123"


# Local Variables:
# mode: shell-script
